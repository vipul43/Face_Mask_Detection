# Face Mask Detection
Detecting the faces of the people in the scene and classify them as with mask and without mask. <br>
The main task of face mask detection is divided into two subtasks. Face Detection task and Mask Classification task. In the former one, faces of humans from a scene(usually with high background noise) is detected. The detected faces are passed as input to the latter task, where the detected faces with mask and detected faces without mask are classified. More Details are provided in the subsequent sections on the tasks. <br>

Dataset contains unlabelled images of people with and without mask(typically with heavy background noise). This dataset contains 4194 unlabelled images. This dataset is intended only for testing purposes and not for training. This dataset is extracted from the open source dataset [Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset) as part of Open Ended Lab Project at IIT Palakkad. Further details about the dataset can be found in the README file present in the dataset.
